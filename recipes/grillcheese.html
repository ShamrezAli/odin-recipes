    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Possibly the easiest breakfast possible, a grilled cheese sandwich is made of
        just a few ingredients and tastes great.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Two slices of any bread, though white bread works best</li>
        <li>1 Tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 slices of american cheese</li>
        <li>A sufficient amount of margarine or butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Coat one side of the bread slices with the margarine or 
            butter and place one onto the pan on low heat</li>
        <li>Place one entire cheese slice on the bread in the pan, butter/margarine 
            side down. Fill in the 'gaps' left by the first slice of cheese by 
            tearing pieces off of the second slice of cheese and adding it 
            to the bread in the pan.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic powder to the cheese on the pan.</li>
        <li>Quickly place the other slice of bread onto the slice in the pan, this time
            with the butter/margarine side up. Press down to seal the sandwich.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat on the pan to medium and press down on the sandwich again. 
            Flip occasionally until both sides are browned.</li>
        <li>Once finished, remove from pan and cut in half diagonally. Serve hot. </li>
    </ol>
