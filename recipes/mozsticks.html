    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 Cheese sticks (optionally cut in half)</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp salt</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 cup Panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>

        <li>Crack the egg into another wide bowl and beat gently.</li>

        <li>Place coated sticks in the freezer for one hour.</li>
        <li>After an hour, remove from freezer and repeat the coating process. Dip
