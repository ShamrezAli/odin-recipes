    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Brussels sprouts have always had an unpopular reputation as a 
        vegetable thanks to so many people growing up eating them boiled. But where
        they really shine is in the oven, crispy and salty. This recipe is how I personally
        make them at home.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Handful of brussels sprouts</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp salt</li>
        <li>1 Tsp pepper</li>
        <li>1 Tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the brussels sprouts in half and put into a bowl. </li>
        <li>Add the salt, pepper, garlic powder, and olive oil to the bowl
            of brussels sprouts.</li>
        <li> Preheat the oven at 330 degrees Fahrenheit with a baking tray inside.</li>
        <li>Once preheated, remove the baking tray and add the cut brussels sprouts
            face down on the tray. This will get the faces properly browned.</li>
        <li>Remove the brussels sprouts after 10-15 minutes or when a desired amount
            of blackening has crisped up the sprouts.</li>
        <li>Carefully put brussels sprouts back into bowl and top with additional
            salt, olive oil, or garlic powder. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
